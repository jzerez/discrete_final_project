### Meeting Notes 11/29
* Spend monday's class getting familair with the problem of stochastic graphs. What are they? What are real life things that they can model? Are there closed form solutions to finding the shortest path through one?
* Ditch the car analogy for now. To start, we will create an arbitrary stochastic graph in networkx with a small number of nodes and edges for more manageable testing
* Talk through our project with Sarah to ensure that we are on a good path and that there is good rigourous math to be had. Also see if she has any suggestions
* Use Jupyter notebooks with atom or vscode for the project and writeup
